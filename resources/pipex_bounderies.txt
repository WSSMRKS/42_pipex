Pipex: execute shell commands inside a program

pipex syntax:
./pipex file1 "ls -l" "wc -l" file2

input checks:
	is file1 a valid adress? (not necessarily folder is fine as well)
											No?-->		no such file or directory: blaa
	do i have permissions? 					No?-->		Permission denied: bla
	is ls a process in envp $PATH? 			No?-->		command not found: tsd
	are the flags valid?					No?-->		invalid option -- 'z'
	-->	process process, parse through pipe;
2nd Command:
	is ls a process in envp $PATH? 			No?-->		command not found: tsd
	are the flags valid?					No?-->		invalid option -- 'z'
	is file2 a valid adress?				No?-->		create file
	Is file2 a folder?						No?-->
	--> process process, save to file

Bonus:
	enable several commands
	enable heredoc --> read from file up to a particular delimiter.
