Description                                     This project is about handling pipes.

Program execution:
./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2

it must take 4 arguments:
    file1 and file2 are filenames.
    cmd1 and cmd2 are shell commands with their parameters

Program must behave exactly the same as:
$> < file1 cmd1 | cmd3 > file2

Examples:
$> ./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile
shell equivalent:
< infile ls -l | wc -l > outfile

$> ./pipex infile "grep a1" "wc -w" outfile
shell equivalent:
< infile grep a1 | wc -w > outfile

error handling same as shell 

Bonus:
support multiple Pipes.
Support << and >> when the first Parameter is "here_doc".

This:
./pipex here_doc LIMITER cmd cmd1 file1
Should behave like this:
cmd << LIMITER | cmd1 >> file
